**Tree Chopper** is a simple mod, which allows chop down whole tree. The only thing you need to do is break the bottom block with an axe. Stop breaking the tree block by block! Just destroy bottom the of trunk and the whole tree will chop down..

*   Tree Chopper can be used as serverside mode, but clientside is recommended (because of non-synchronous visual breaking)
*   Supports mods (e.g. Biomes O' Plenty, Forestry, Tinkers Construct).
*   Can be deactivated by holding SHIFT.
*   Config with settings and list of allowed axes and types of wood.
*   Option to reverse function (chopping with SHIFT)

#### Usage
Type in-game command "/tch help" for more info.

#### Add new wood or axe
Add UnlocalizedName of new item into "treechopper.cfg" (appdata/roaming/.minecraft/config/treechopper/) between > and < . You can use in-game command "/tch printName 1" for start to print the names.
